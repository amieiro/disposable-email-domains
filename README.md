## Disposable Email Domains

Disposable email domain lists, used in disposable email services, generated every quarter of an hour, in txt and JSON format.

You can find [here](https://github.com/amieiro/disposable-email-domains/blob/master/creator/app/Console/Commands/CreateDisposableEmailDomainsFilesCommand.php#L16) the lists used by this project to obtain the blocked and allowed domains. This project maintains this list of [secure domains](https://github.com/amieiro/disposable-email-domains/blob/master/secureDomains.txt).

## Files

- **denyDomains**. List of known e-mail domains used disposable email services and should be blocked. Available in [txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amieiro/disposable-email-domains/master/denyDomains.txt) and [json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amieiro/disposable-email-domains/master/denyDomains.json) format.
- **allowDomains**. List of well-known email domains that are not disposable and should be allowed. Available in [txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amieiro/disposable-email-domains/master/allowDomains.txt) and [json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amieiro/disposable-email-domains/master/allowDomains.json) format.
- **secureDomains**. Internal list of known e-mail domains that are secure. Used to generate the denyDomains files.

## Usage

You can use these files in your projects to block disposable email domains. 
- First, you should check if the domain is in the allow list, using the allowDomains file. 
- If it is not, you should check if the domain is in the deny list, using the denyDomains file.

For example, in PHP:

```php
$emailDomain = 'gmail.com';
$allowDomains = file_get_contents('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amieiro/disposable-email-domains/master/allowDomains.json');
$allowDomains = json_decode($allowDomains, true);
if (in_array($emailDomain, $allowDomains)) {
    echo 'This domain is allowed.';
}

$emailDomain = 'temp-mail.org';
$denyDomains = file_get_contents('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amieiro/disposable-email-domains/master/denyDomains.json');
$denyDomains = json_decode($denyDomains, true);
if (in_array($emailDomain, $denyDomains)) {
    echo 'This domain is disposable.';
}
```

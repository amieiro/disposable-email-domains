## Disposable Email Domains

Hourly automated generated disposable email domains lists, in txt and JSON format.

You can find [here](https://github.com/amieiro/disposable-email-domains/blob/master/creator/app/Console/Commands/CreateDisposableEmailDomainsFilesCommand.php#L11) the lists used by this project to obtain the blocked and allowed domains. This project maintains this list of [secure domains](https://github.com/amieiro/disposable-email-domains/blob/master/secureDomains.txt).
